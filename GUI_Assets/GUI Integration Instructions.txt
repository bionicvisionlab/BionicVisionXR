When adding all of these components to a scene, make sure that they are placed on a Canvas that is not blocked by other GameObjects;
otherwise the UI components cannot be accessed when the scene is being played. One suggestion is to place the components on the Canvas
under GameObject/Player Camera (1) if such a GameObject exists in the scene.
